# School District Analysis on High School Math and Reading Scores

## Project Overview
####  After reviewing Math and Reading Test Scores fot the high schools in the district, there is evidence of academic dishonestly; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. We want to uphold state-testing standards. We will replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact to retrieve a school district analysis for testing to be presented to the school board.

#### In this project, we will replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs. work together to create Python code to analyze the CSV data file to find the elections results. Additionally, we present a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used, with some modifications, for any election in the future. We used a pseudocode which will make the audit easier to present to colleagues and stakeholders. When looking at the code below, code with the "#" will act as a roadmap of what the steps will take to complete the task of the elections results. This will aid in following the data and recognizing where sections can be altered to analyze future elections given the same data file type. 

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook

## Results

#### The analysis of the election show that:

## Summary
Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs. There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced.
