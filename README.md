# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview :Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
#### A Colorado Board of Elections employees, Tom and Seth, has given us a CSV (comma-seperated-values) data file consisting of a number for the ballot ID and a name for the county and candidate, respectively. At this point, we don't know how many counties and candidates are in the file. Overall, the data appears readable and there are no unusual row values that we can see. We have been given election audit tasks to analyze the data and produce the election results to be presented to the election committee. 

#### In this project, we will work together to create Python code to analyze the CSV data file to find the elections results. Additionally, we present a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used, with some modifications, for any election in the future. We used a pseudocode which will make the audit easier to present to colleagues and stakeholders. When looking at the code below, code with the "#" will act as a roadmap of what the steps will take to complete the task of the elections results. This will aid in following the data and recognizing where sections can be altered to analyze future elections given the same data file type. 

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.70.2

## Results

#### The analysis of the election show that:
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
  - 
  - 
  - 
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  - 
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type

#### After running the python code, the following results were displayed in a text file for easy viewing:

## Summary
Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs. There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced.
