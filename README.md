# School District Analysis on High School Math and Reading Scores

## Project Overview
####  The school board has to set the budget for the upcoming school year. After reviewing Math and Reading Test Scores for the high schools in the district, there is evidence of academic dishonestly; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. We want to uphold state-testing standards. We will replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact to retrieve a school district analysis for testing to be presented to the school board.

#### In this project, we will replace the math and reading scores for nineth graders at Thomas High School with NaNs and create a better analysis for the school board of the Math and Reading Test Scores. We will also determine how the changes to the data altered the overall analysis. We will show data filtered the scores by size of school, spending per student, and type of school. This data will help the district determine how much money should be allocated to and spent on each school.
